An officer may use deadly force in the circumstances permitted by this policy when all reasonable alternatives appear impracticable and the officer reasonably believes that the use of deadly force is necessary. Officers should ensure that they do not engage in unreasonable actions that precipitate the use of force as a result of tactical, strategic, and procedural errors that place themselves or others in jeopardy. The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight. The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments, in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving, about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation. The reasonableness inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one; the question is whether the officersƒÉ√ç actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\" p. 105-1\n  \"STATE STATUTES\n  a. C.R.S. _18-1-707 states in the pertinent part: Use of physical force in making an arrest or in preventing an escape:\n  1. \"(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a peace officer is justified in using reasonable and appropriate physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he reasonably believes it necessary:\n  a. To effect an arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of an arrested person unless he knows that the arrest is unauthorized; or\n  b. To defend him self or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force while effecting or attempting to affect such an arrest or while preventing or attempting to prevent such an escape.\n  2. A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person for a purpose specified in subsection (1) of this section only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary:\n  a. To defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force; or\n  b. To affect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he reasonably believes:\n  1. Has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon; or\n  2. Is attempting to escape by the use of a deadly weapon; or\n  3. Otherwise indicates, except through a motor vehicle violation, that he is likely to endanger human life or to inflict serious bodily injury to another unless apprehended without delay. (The Denver Police Department policy on use of deadly force in this situation is more restrictive than state law _ see OMS 105.05(5).\n  ...\n  4. For the purposes of this section a reasonable belief that a person has committed an offense means a reasonable belief in facts or circumstances which if true would in law constitute an offense. If the believed facts and circumstances would not in law constitute an offense, an erroneous though not unreasonable belief that the law is otherwise does not render justifiable the use of force to make an arrest or to prevent an escape from custody. A peace officer who is affecting an arrest pursuant to a warrant is justified in using the physical force prescribed in subsection (1) and (2) of this section unless the warrant is invalid and is known by the officer to be invalid.\"\n  b. The community expects and the Denver Police Department requires that peace officers use only the force necessary to perform their duties. The level of force applied must reflect the totality of circumstances surrounding the immediate situation. The officer need only select a level of force that is necessary and within the range of _objectively reasonable options. Officers must rely on training, experience and assessment of the situation to decide an appropriate level of force to be applied. Reasonable and sound judgment will dictate the force option to be employed.\" p. 105-2 & 105-3",

Clearly, not every potential violent confrontation can be de-escalated, but officers do have the ability to impact the direction and the outcome of many situations they handle, based on their decision-making and the tactics they choose to employ.\n  When reasonable under the totality of circumstances, officers should gather information about the incident, assess the risks, assemble resources, attempt to slow momentum, and communicate and coordinate a response.

Instead, Department Policy allows officers to use deadly force whenever they \"reasonably\" believe there to be an imminent threat, even if reasonable alternatives such as non-lethal force could have been effectively used instead.\nPolicy Language: 7. Lethal Force: Includes the use of a firearm or any force which has a reasonable likelihood of causing death or grave physical harm.\na. Deputies are expected to use reasonable and informed professional judgment when making decisions about the use of lethal force, remaining aware that lethal force is the last alternative.\nb. Lethal force should only be considered in situations presenting a grave threat to the public or the deputy when absolute and immediate tactics must be deployed to stop the lethal threat and secure conclusive compliance and control.\nc. The decision to use lethal force can only be justified by the facts or information known to the deputy when the decision to use lethal force is made. Facts unknown to the deputy, no matter how compelling, cannot be considered later in determining whether the use of lethal force was justified.\nd. Lethal force may justifiably be used by deputies in the performance of their official duties under the following circumstances and after all other reasonable means of apprehension and control have failed, or where such other means reasonably appear to be ineffectual:\ne. In the necessary defense of themselves or a third person from what they reasonably believe to be the use or imminent use of lethal force.\nf. To effect the arrest, to prevent an escape, or to recapture an escapee when the deputy reasonably believes the subject has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use, or threatened use, of a lethal force, and when the deputy reasonably believes that a substantial risk exists that the felony suspect to be arrested will cause death or grave physical harm if apprehension is delayed.\n3. 1) 6. Responsibility for Use of Firearm: The use of firearms or lethal force has the potential of resulting in a homicide. For the homicide to be justifiable, the deputy must show there was no other reasonable alternative under the circumstances. Each individual has the full responsibility of determining when he is justified in using a firearm or force likely to produce great bodilyharm.\n3. 1) 4. Authorized Discharge of Firearms: All members of this Office may discharge their\nfirearms under the following conditions:\nd. To affect an arrest when all other means have failed of a felony suspect(s) when: 1. The crime for which the arrest is sought involved conduct that included the use or threatened use of deadly force, and 2. There is a substantial risk that the person whose arrest is being sought will cause death or serious bodily harm if his apprehension is delayed.",

This is accomplished by establishing parameters which exhibit the actions of both the subject and the deputy on a comparative scale. A force continuum by design should be consistent with the approved written Use of Force Policy of the Office, and should be easily understood and readily recalled by deputies under the stress of the confrontation. It is also valuable as a training aid in preparing for situations which may require the use of force.\nSituation-Based Use of Force Continuum\nThe attached use of force continuum (See Appendix A) is designed to provide an overview and visual representation of the force options available to deputies in this Office.

Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.\nImminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:\n1. The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.\n2.
